def dirichlet_linear_alpha_rule(N):

    i * (contribution of player 1).

    Parameters

    N - int, the number of players in a state

    players contribute according to the low alpha, and N-n contribute according
    to the high alpha. These form two distinct sets of components for the
    vector obtained via the dirichlet distribution - those with a low mean and those with a high mean.

    Parameters
    -----------
    N - int, the number of players in a state

    n - int, the number of players who contribute according to the low alpha

    low_alpha - float, a strictly positive value for the low mean cooperators to

def dirichlet_log_alpha_rule(N):

    Generates the alphas for a population contributing according to a

    distribution. Each player's alpha is equal to the natural log of their
    position in the state +1 (in order to ensure strict positivity among the
    alphas, since otherwise player 1 would have $\alpha = 0$). Therefore, as we
    take the mean across many realisations, we get a logarithmic scale where
    the mean contribution for each player is always greater than the last, but
    the difference decreases as N increases.

    Parameters
    -----------
    N - int, the number of players in a state

    player's alpha is equal to $a^i$, with $a = e$ by default, where $i$ is
    their index in the state (indexed from 1). Therefore, as we take the mean
    across many realisations, we get an exponential scale where the mean
    contribution for each player increases exponentially (though not
    necessarily using the exponential $e$)

    Parameters
    -----------

    a - float, the base of the power law (the number which is raised to the
